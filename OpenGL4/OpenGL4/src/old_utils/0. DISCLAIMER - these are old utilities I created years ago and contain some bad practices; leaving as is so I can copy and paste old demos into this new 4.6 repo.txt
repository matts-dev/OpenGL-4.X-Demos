DISCLAIMER - these are old utilities I created years ago and contain some bad practices;
leaving as is so I can copy and paste old demos into this new 4.6 repo.


NOTE: copying form old repo uses an older version of glm; be sure to search for all glm::mat4 and mat4 and replace all default-constructed
matrices to be glm::mat4(1.0f); instead of glm::mat4();. The newer versions of glm do not default construct to an identiy matrix.
